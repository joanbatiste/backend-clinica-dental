## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Create an appointment management system for a Clinic Dental.
The user must be able to register in the application, login
to access your client area, in addition to that you must be able to see a list of your visits and future appointments.
The application should allow you to cancel a specific appointment.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

First of all we start the terminal of our code editor, in my case the Virtual Studio Code, and we start the default package management system for Node.js (npm) with the text npm init. Then we installed Express, MySql, Sequelize and Nodemon. All this to build the server and have a database.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This BackEnd must be used through the Postman program or similar since we do not have a FrontEnd with which to see the results.

The project meets the minimum requirements for use by clients and is prepared to register an admin user as a clinic that can manage and have access to all data.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

This BackEnd must be used through the Postman program or similar since we do not have a FrontEnd with which to see the results.

For some options you must log in as a user since you will not be able to see or delete the appointments that the logged in user has.

To make it easier for you to see it, we have created a shortcut to Postman.
